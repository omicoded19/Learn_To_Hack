strings (extract printable strings from binary data)

Description:
strings is a Linux/Unix command used to extract human-readable text from binary files.
It scans files for sequences of printable characters and prints them to stdout.

In CTFs and cybersecurity work, strings is commonly used to:

Find hidden flags in binaries

Inspect executables, images, or memory dumps

Quickly locate URLs, passwords, error messages, or clues without reverse engineering

Usage:

strings [OPTIONS] file


By default, it prints printable strings of length 4 or more.

Useful Flags in strings
Output control:

-n <number> or --bytes=<number>
Minimum string length to display.

strings -n 8 file.bin


Shows only strings with at least 8 characters.
Useful to reduce noise.

Encoding awareness:

-e <encoding>
Specify character encoding.

strings -e l file.bin


Common values:

s → 7-bit ASCII (default)

l → 16-bit little endian (UTF-16LE)

b → 16-bit big endian (UTF-16BE)

Very useful for Windows binaries and Unicode-heavy files.

File offsets:

-t <format>
Print the offset of each string in the file.

strings -t x file.bin


Formats:

d → decimal

x → hexadecimal

o → octal

Offsets help when correlating strings with disassembly or hex editors.

File type handling:

-a
Scan the entire file, not just initialized data sections.

strings -a suspicious.img


Helpful for disk images, memory dumps, or raw blobs.

Quiet behavior:

-f
Print file name before each string (useful when scanning multiple files).

strings -f *.bin

Help/version:

--help
Display help text.

--version
Show version information.

Examples
strings file.exe


Quick scan for readable clues.

strings -n 10 image.jpg


Extract longer embedded strings from an image.

strings -e l memory.dump | grep flag

Search Unicode strings for flags.
